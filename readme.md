## JavaScript Drills
Let's start practicing our JavaScript skills with some fun drills. Begin by opening the `starter.js` file in your editor of choice (i.e. Sublime or Atom). All of your work will go into this file. As you complete each step you can test your solutions in the Node repl, or by typing `node starter.js` in the Terminal.

Make sure to `git add ` and `git commit ` often as you work through your assignment. It's super important to get into the habit of regular git add/commits.

#### 1. Pythagorean Theorem
Write a JavaScript statement that solves the pythagorean theorem.
Don't know what the pythagorean theorem is? Google might! :smile:

#### 2. Basic Conversion - Pounds to kg
Write a JavaScript statement that converts weight in pounds (lb) to kilograms (kg)?

#### 3. Old Modems
How long would it take to download a 25GB ripped copy of Blade starring Wesley Snipes over a $200 56k/s modem from 1995? That's kbps, **kilobit**, not kilobyte (that's an extra conversion step). You're going to have to dig for conversion here. Save the calculated answer to a variable and then log (console.log) the answer.

#### Bonus:
Convert your answer in the form of hours:minutes:seconds. Hint: Look into using the modulus operator(%).

#### 4. Killer Caffeine

It's estimated that 6 grams per hundred pounds of body weight can cause death! Given an 8oz cup of coffee has 95mg of caffeine, calculate how many cups it takes to kill YOU (use whatever weight you want).

#### 5. Instructors

Given the array:
```javascript
var instructors = ['Patrick Andre', 'Joe Keohan', 'Jon Zachary', 'Matt Kersner', 'dominic farquharson']
```

- Write a JavaScript function that prints (console.log) all the instructors to the console
- Write a function that adds a new instructor, 'John Carmack', to our instructors array and prints the staff to the console
- On second though, it appears Mr. Carmack won't be joining our team - write a function that removes our last intructor from our array and prints the new staff to the console

#### 6. I'm gonna have to see some ID

Given the variable:

```javascript
var age = 19
```

Write an function with an if/else statement that checks the value of `age`. If `age` is 21 or higher, print "OK, you can have a drink". If age is under 21, print "Get lost kid! We don't server minors here!!".

## Bonus. Put the **FUN** in functions

Redo parts 1 through 4 and instead of a statement, write functions that take parameters and return the correct values.

## Homework Submission:
Homework is due tonight by **11pm**. Follow the [Homework Guide](https://git.generalassemb.ly/nyc-wdi-hypatia/hypatia-students/blob/master/hw-workflow.md) for submission instructions.

#### Don't forget to get some sleep!!
